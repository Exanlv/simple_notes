# Simple Notes
A simple note taking application built on electron using typescript.

The goal of this project is to replace what I use Joplin for now, taking simple notes in markdown. Joplin has a lot of features I dont need so I wanted to make something I could use instead of it.

Built on electron as I wanted to get some experience using it. Great performance and being minimalist is not a main goal of this project.

# Platform support
Linux
MacOS (WIP)

# Running locally
Dependencies
```
tsc
```

Clone the project, `npm install`, `npm start`

`npm start` compiles the typescript and runs the electron app.
